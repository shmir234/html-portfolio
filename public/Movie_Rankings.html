<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p> This is my favorite movie of all time. I think the plot/performances are top tier. </p>

<h3>Perfect Days</h3>
<p> Amazing movie. Really makes you appreciate the little things in life </p>

<h3>About Time</h3>
<p> A Rom-Com with a twist that is so much more than what it initially presents itself to be. </p>
